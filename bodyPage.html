          It’s no secret that you’ll find some of the top slopes in the world. Thousands of people flock to the hundreds of resorts that are scattered across the country. Among them are some the best in the world for a great ski experience and the most spectacular, for their outstanding beauty, or overall experience. If you’re travelling on a budget you still have several options to ski in Switzerland.</div>

            Some of the world’s top snowboarders, freestylers and skiers frequently head to Switzerland to take part in international competitions. The Brits, which features Britain’s top snow pros, the Ski World Cup and the Freestyle Championships are just a few of the tournaments that have graced Swiss slopes over the years.</div>

        <div class = 'article'><strong class='article-title'>It’s snow sure (for now)</strong><br>
          Many of Switzerland’s ski resorts boast guaranteed snow during the winter season. With temperatures creeping up and the weather becoming less predictable, those around the 1,000m mark are no longer so certain. But for now there still plenty of resorts that can guarantee you snow throughout the winter season.</div>

          Whether you are a complete newbie or a near-pro brushing up on their technique, there is a host of ski schools across the country that will cater to your needs. Kids can also get their first taste of the slopes with professional and accredited coaches. Most resorts have a good mix of slopes that are suited to all levels.</div>

          St Moritz has hosted the Winter Olympics twice, once in 1928 and again in 1948, and is the only Swiss resort to have done so. Granted this was several decades ago, but it’s testament to the standing which the glitzy resort has within the skiing world.</div>

          For many, Zermatt is the top ski destination in Switzerland. It brings together most of the above; top-class slopes, is snow sure (from around November to April) and offers everything you’d need for a comfortable holiday. All of this is rolled into a small town that sits in the shadow of the might Matterhorn, the iconic lonely mountain of Switzerland.</div>

                  What this resort lacks in stature it makes up for in style. While it may be modest in size, it still boasts some exceptional slopes in addition to its utterly breathtaking alpine scenery. The resort itself sits at 1,600m (5,250ft), with ski lifts going a further 600m (1,970ft) higher up. Half the runs at La Fouly are black, while the other half comprise a mixture of blue and red runs. The slopes face west. For a good feed afterwards make sure you head to Hotel Edelweiss.</div>

                  The small village of Rosswald is based in the east of Valais, in the Simplon region. Beautifully placed in a consistently sunny spot that overlooks the Rhone Valley, its slopes are varied enough to suit riders of all abilities. While the variation makes Rosswald a fantastic family option, the area’s black runs are incredibly steep and provide a challenge for even the most skilled of riders. There are four ski lifts that bring you up to 2,600m (8,530ft), and there are 25km (16mi) of pristine pistes to enjoy.</div>

                  Situated between 2,000m (6,560ft) and a fraction under 3,000m (9,840ft), Arolla boasts exquisite conditions throughout the season thanks, in part, to its location in one of the most spectacular valleys in the Alps. Its height also ensures that the season is long, and given how good the snow is here, it’s surprising – not to mention pleasing – how quiet the 47km (29mi) of slopes can be. Six lifts look after the area, with nearly half the pistes made up of red runs.</div>

                  The area of Val d’Anniviers consists of five resorts. St-Luc and Chandolin make up two of those five and feature 60km (37mi) worth of piste and a snow park between 1,650m (5,410ft) and 3,000m (9,840ft) altitude. The two resorts combined make up the biggest, sunniest snowboarding spot in the area. The south-facing slopes are relatively quiet, with only a few freestyle options but plenty when it comes to off-piste. It’s a great place for getting away from the bustle of the popular resorts.</div>

                  Lauchernalp is a small, fairly typical Swiss ski resort. Despite its size, it offers fantastic variety, with the highest point just above 3,000m (9,840ft) and a massive skiable vertical. There are nearly 90km (56mi) of pistes, and it’s possible to ride – off and on piste – right down into the Lötschen valley villages for a genuine taste of traditional Switzerland. The height of the resort ensures brilliant snow quality, the powder is great, and there are a bunch of free-ride options too. Although Lauchernalp is popular, it’s rare to get crowds on the slopes, with plenty of fresh snow to take on.</div>

                  If you want guaranteed snow right up until the middle of spring and stunning views of the Alps’ highest peaks, head to Visperterminen. The area has 20km (12mi) of ski slopes that reach as high as 2,300m (7,550ft), accessible by two rope tows, two T-bar lifts and a chairlift. There are two hotels and 10 instructors at the on-site ski school, which offers snowboarding lessons four days a week. For anyone who fancies an afternoon tipple, it’s worth noting the region also boasts Europe’s highest vineyards.</div>

                  Cyclists can get so caught up in checking off big mountain passes (or cols), that they miss the magic of the small stuff. On day one, Alain showed up at the Hotel Alpe Fleurie in Villars-sur-Ollon with a rented Scott Foil for me, and by pedal stroke number two we were climbing a steep section of the Col de la Croix, a pass that connects Villars-sur-Ollon with neighboring Les Diablerets. I was tired from my flight and needed to dial in my bike fit, so instead of going up and over the pass, we turned onto a secondary road, as narrow as an alley, that wound through alpine meadows and skirted a dramatic rock face. As the lane turned to dirt and storm clouds began to gather (common late-afternoon weather in the Alps), a choir of cowbells transformed the little valley into an echoing cathedral. </div>

                  Cows are a big deal in Switzerland. In summer, they wander the hillsides heading to higher elevations as the temperature rises. The alpine climate (plenty of rain and sunshine) means primo grazing—Switzerland’s milk, butter, and cheese are famous for a reason. There’s a good chance you’ll encounter a herd just chilling alongside the road (or even smack in the middle of it). You have two choices: either keep going, or turn around while the person you’re riding with sets up the perfect shot, then ride that section again. This was on day two: an up-and-down route of mostly back roads and some gravel, starting and finishing in Les Diablerets.</div>

                  After the vineyards on Sanetsch is a series of switchbacks that wind through alpine woodland. The air felt cooler at the higher elevation, and the grade seemed to mellow out a bit. I took the opportunity to sit up, stretch my legs, and shake out my arms. I rode this switchback twice so Alain could get the perfect shot, which he does for all his clients many times over the course of a ride. It’s pretty amazing to see yourself riding through a vista you might not have had the wherewithal to fully appreciate in the moment.</div>

                  Tunnels are not uncommon in the high mountains. On Sanetsch there are three. The first two are short and no big deal (I’m riding through one of them in this photo). The third is a half-mile-long, dank stretch of gloom. Though it’s outfitted with motion-activated lights, I was still spooked, mostly worried that drivers wouldn’t see me. I had reflective stripes on my vest (which I’d put on by the time I entered the third tunnel), but front and rear lights on my bike would have made me feel better. That tunnel was probably my fastest half a mile on the whole of Sanetsch. </div>

                  Just after the summit on Sanetsch, there’s a hotel/restaurant called Auberge Sanetsch, a red-roofed, chalet-style cluster of buildings. You’ll have gotten off your bike, done your happy dance, even descended a bit, before you have to climb a steep ramp and then a gravel path to get there. But it’s worth it. We ordered the assiette valaisanne, the regional version of antipasto with cured meats, local cheeses, fruit, nuts, and a basket of thick-sliced bread. Oh, and Cokes because we couldn’t imagine drinking anything else. There’s also an outdoor tap (common in the Alps) where you can fill your bottle. I did, and the water was icy cold and delicious.</div>
